# HW9.23.20WeatherDashboard

This is a simple weather dashboard.

The user first enters a name in the City Input field.

The app, then takes that city and reaches out to the OpenWeather API and gets back three different data sets: current weather, UV Index, forecast weather.

This information is displayed appropriately to show the current weather (with the date) and the forecaste weather over the next five days.

Additionally, the app is *supposed to* store the most recently displayed information locally. (working on it).

Also also, the app, does log a history of the searched cities. That history is built up as buttons which *should be* easily clicked and the information is appropiratedly updated. (working on it).

Below is an image of what it looks like.
